# Wildfire-Analysis-DataScienceProject

## Introduction
Every year, the wildfires are destroying the areas, houses near the forest in the United States and around the world. It’s high time to study the causes of wildfires in the area to avoid the situation in the future. Which will benefit the government to prevent the forest area from such activities. I will be working on wildfire data, how to use ML algorithm to predict the wildfire causes in the United States. I am taking the ‘fire’ column of this wildfire dataset and calculating the percentage accuracy for all possible causes that could initiate fires in top states.

## Objective
1. Analyzing and predicting the wildfire causes?
2. Data Analysis and Data visualization
3. Figuring out the top fire horizontal locations
4. Apply Machine Learning Algorithms to explore and predict the causes of wildfi   res in United States.
5. Dataset Description & Source Link
